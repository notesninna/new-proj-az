### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

- For this project, I chose to deploy using the App Service. In terms of cost it is cheaper than VM. For scalability, Web App is also enough since the deployed app is just lightweight and did not need high compute. For the workflow, the Web App was efficient choice since I only needed to connect to github with my code and did not spend time and effort on the infrastructure.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 
I would change fmy decision into using a Virtual Machine if it would require more compute power since App Services have hardware limitations.
